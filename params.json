{"name":"PicNameSort","tagline":"A utility to change the name of pictures to help organize them","body":"#PicNameSort\r\nPicNameSort is a script utility to change the file name for pictures to sort them, and help identify them.\r\n\r\nSay you have a folder of pictures with names like \"IMG_0281.jpg\".\r\nIt keeps them in sequential order, but it's not very descriptive.\r\nWhat PicNameSort does is grabs the date the picture was taken, then changes the file name to the date.\r\n\r\nThe name is formatted based on ISO format, and would look like \"2014-03-06_14-12-39.jpg\".\r\nThis keeps your pictures in sequential order, can help you identify the picture, and also would retain the date and time you took it should it ever change.\r\n\r\nIf there's already a file with the same name as the picture then the name of the file will be the same, but with \"_X\" added to it, where X is the lowest number that makes it original (i.e. \"2014-03-06_14-12-39_1.jpg\")\r\n\r\nPicNameSort also creates a file called \"Picture-Descriptions.txt\", which will have the new names of your pictures in it.\r\nNote that if a file named Picture-Descriptions.txt already exists in the same directory, it won't be erased, but will be appended.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** Back up your pictures, and make sure they all made it!\r\nPicNameSort does its best not to overwrite pictures, and should just move on if there's an error making a new name or copying a file.\r\nIt will also make a folder with copies of your pictures just in case.\r\nBut you should still verify came out right before deleting the backups.\r\n\r\n**Note:** There's a small glitch where if you use PicNameSort on a picture with the same name as it would become, then it will be changed to the \"_X\" format.\r\nThis should still be safe for you pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n###Dependencies\r\nPicNameSort is fairly simple to use.\r\nIt depends on Bash, and <a href=\"http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\">ExifTool</a> being installed.\r\nFor the AppleScript wrapper, ExifTool needs to be installed in the default path\\*.\r\nThe ExifTool installer and if it's installed through Homebrew will both be fine.\r\n\r\nBecause it uses Bash, it'll be a bit trickier to get it to work with Windows.\r\n\r\n###Command Line\r\nUsage for the command line version looks like this:\r\n\r\n`$ ./PicNameSort.sh [path]`\r\n\r\nPath can be the path to a single image or a directory.\r\nIf it's a directory then it only does images at that level.\r\n\r\nPicNameSort uses ExifTool to check if the file is an image, and wont attempt to convert images without a mimetype that doesn't include \"image\".\r\n\r\n###AppleScript App\r\nThe AppleScript version is a wrapper in the form of a proper application for OSX.\r\nIt's essentially just an interface for the command line version, but can be easier to use for someone who'd rather use a GUI instead of a terminal.\r\n\r\n> If you downloaded just the source, then you'll need to compile the app yourself.\r\n> This is easily done by running `./PrepApp.sh`.\r\n> Developers: this needs to be done if you're using the .app and modify the Bash script.\r\n\r\nThe app was made to be pretty self explanatory.\r\nTo use it, launch the PicNameSort.app, then select if you want to rename a single picture or all the pictures in a folder.\r\nIf you select a folder, then it will only format the pictures at that level.\r\nIt won't touch any files in a subfolder.\r\n\r\nYou wont see anything while it's working, but when it's done you'll have the option to see the output log, rename more pictures, or quit.\r\n\r\nThe output log is what you would see if you would see if you were running this through the command line.\r\nIf everything works right, you won't really need to bother with it.\r\n\r\n\\* Default path is `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/sbin/`, `/sbin`\r\n(To quit the app before converting, close it by right clicking the dock)\r\n\r\n##Contributing and Help\r\nIf you have any problems then open a request on GitHub.\r\n\r\nIf you have any code contributions then feel free to submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n##License\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Nate Rauh\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
